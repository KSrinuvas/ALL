A soft and fluffy Velveteen Rabbit lived in a toybox in a Boy's room.  
And Velveteen Rabbit was happy.
Then newer, brighter toys came into the toybox.  
They had special tricks.  Some could move when the Boy pushed a button.  
Others bounced high.  Velveteen Rabbit had no special tricks or buttons. 
No wonder the Boy started to choose these other new toys.  
At night, when the toys were back all in the toybox, the other toys talked with pride about the fine things they could do.
Velveteen Rabbit was quiet.  
There was not much to say.
Only one other toy in the toy box was like Velveteen Rabbit. 
Cowboy Horse was also a soft, fluffy toy.  But he was old. 
Most of his hair was worn away.  He had only one eye left.
Cowboy Horse said to Velveteen Rabbit, 
Soft toys like us are really the lucky ones.  
We get loved the most.  
And when soft toys get loved and loved, 
What is Real said Velveteen Rabbit.
Being Real is the best said Skin Horse.
When you are Real, if you are loved, you can show your love back
